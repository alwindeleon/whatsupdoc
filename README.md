#Whats UP Doc
With “whatsupDoc?,” we eliminate the ambiguity and uncertainty that surrounds the visit to the doctor. Does my insurance cover the services I need? Does it cover the services needed for my child? Which doctors around me are the best for my mother’s cancer treatment? Perhaps I want to know if the person in charge of my paralyzed father is an optimistic and tender care-taker or someone who’ll tell me the not-so-great details. “whatsupDoc?” is a tool that can be used by anyone, anytime whenever they need to know anything pertaining to their health.
